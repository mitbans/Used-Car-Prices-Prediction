### Data Exploration

In the Data Exploration phase, we conducted a thorough analysis to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the dataset. Key activities included:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated summary statistics for each numerical feature, such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. This provided a high-level overview of the data distribution and central tendencies.
- **Distribution Analysis:** Visualized the distributions of key variables (e.g., price, year, odometer) using histograms and density plots to understand their spread and identify any skewness or kurtosis. This helped in detecting potential outliers and understanding the general data shape.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Computed correlation coefficients between numerical variables to identify linear relationships. Visualized these correlations using heatmaps, which highlighted significant correlations (e.g., between year and price, odometer and price).
- **Missing Values Analysis:** Identified columns with missing values and calculated the proportion of missing data for each column. Visualized missing data patterns using heatmaps to understand the extent and distribution of missingness across the dataset.
- **Categorical Data Analysis:** Examined the distribution of categorical variables (e.g., manufacturer, fuel, transmission) using bar plots and pie charts. This analysis provided insights into the most common categories and their frequencies.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identified outliers in numerical features by visualizing box plots and scatter plots. Assessed the potential impact of these outliers on the analysis and modeling process.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Explored relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., price vs. year, price vs. odometer) using scatter plots and box plots. This helped in understanding how different features interact and influence the target variable (price).

These exploratory analyses laid the foundation for subsequent data preparation and modeling steps, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and guiding informed decisions throughout the project.

## Data Preparation

In the Data Preparation phase we focused on transforming the raw dataset into a clean and structured format suitable for modeling. This phase is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our predictive model. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the steps taken:

- **Data Cleaning:**
    - **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values were identified and handled across various columns such as year, manufacturer, model, condition, cylinders, fuel type, odometer readings, title status, transmission type, drive type, size category, car type, paint color, and state.
    - **Handling Outliers:** remove, transforming (e.g., using log transformation), or cap outliers (set a limit on extreme values).
    - **Remove duplicates**
    - **Handling incorrect data types** None required
    - **Handling inconsistent data** (example: age shouldn't be negative), None required
- **Split data into training and test sets:**
This partitioning ensured that the model could be trained on a subset of data and tested for optimal performance. The primary reason for performing a train/test split before feature engineering and modeling is to prevent data leakage and to ensure that the evaluation of your model is accurate and indicative of its performance on unseen data.
    - Prevention of Data Leakage
    - Accurate Evaluation
    - Ethical Modeling Practices
- **Feature Engineering / Data Transformation:**
    - **Normalization/Scaling:** Numerical features such as price, vehicle_age, and odometer readings were scaled using techniques like Min-Max scaling to bring them within a standardized range, optimizing the performance of machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to varying scales.
    - **Polynomial Features:** Numerical features such as price, vehicle_age, and odometer were transformed using Polynomial features fundction with degree 2.
    - **Encoding Categorical Variables:**
        - **Target Encoding:** make_model was encoded using target encoding.
        - **one-hot encoding:** fuel, transmission, type, paint_color were encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical format.
        - **Ordinal Encoding:** condition, cylinders, title_status, drive, size were encoding using ordinal encoding.
    - **New features** were derived or modified from existing ones to enhance predictive power.
        - For example, creating a derived feature like **"vehicle age"** from the difference between the current year and the year of manufacture could provide deeper insights into pricing dynamics based on depreciation.
        - **make_model** was created to combine manufacturer and model columns.

By meticulously preparing the dataset in this manner, we established a solid foundation for building and evaluating predictive models that accurately forecast used car prices. This phase not only enhanced data quality but also streamlined subsequent phases of modeling, evaluation, and deployment within the CRISP-DM framework.

## Modeling
In the Modeling phase, we aimed to develop a robust predictive model to forecast used car prices based on the cleaned and transformed dataset. Key steps and considerations include:
- **Model Selection:**
We evaluated various regression models suitable for predicting continuous variables, such as Linear, Ridge, Lasso Regression.
Each model was selected based on its ability to handle the dataset's characteristics, interpretability, and potential for achieving high prediction accuracy.
- **Model Training:**
The selected models were trained using the training dataset, which was prepared during the data preparation phase.
Parameters were tuned using techniques like grid search combined with cross-validation to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.

### Modeling Output
Linear Regression has the best performance among the four models with the lowest RMSE and the highest R2 value. It is the most suitable model for this dataset based on the given metrics. Similar output from Ridge and Lasso, which can further be evaluated for different alphas.

- **Results:**
    - Linear Regression: RMSE = 5676.3165, R2 = 0.6510
    - Ridge Regression: RMSE = 5676.3202, R2 = 0.6510
    - Lasso Regression: RMSE = 5676.6817, R2 = 0.6509
    - Elastic Net Regression: RMSE = 6160.6749, R2 = 0.5889
      
- **`RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) = 5676.3165`**: This value indicates the average error in the predictions. In this context, it means that on average, the model's predictions are off by about 5676.3165 units from the actual values of the car price.

- **`R2 (R-squared) = 0.6510`**: This value indicates that approximately 65.10% of the variance in the target variable (price) is explained by the features in the model. While this is a good level of explanation, it indicates that there is still about 35% of unexplained variance, suggesting room for model improvement.

## Evaluation
In the Evaluation phase, we assessed the performance of the trained models to ensure they met our project objectives and business requirements:

- **Metrics:**
We used several evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to quantify the accuracy of predictions. These metrics provided insights into how well the models predicted used car prices compared to actual values.

- **Validation:**
The models were validated using the test dataset, which was set aside during the data preparation phase.
This step ensured that the models generalized well to unseen data and avoided overfitting to the training dataset.

- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**, a measure of multicollinearity in a set of regression variables was used but found not helpful in improving the model performance. 
  - **Interpretation of VIF Results**
The VIF results provided show that several features have inf (infinity) values, indicating perfect multicollinearity. This means that these features are exact linear combinations of other features in the dataset, leading to an inability to estimate the coefficients uniquely.

    - **Features with Infinite VIF**
      - **Paint Colors:** All paint colors have infinite VIF, suggesting they are perfectly collinear.
      - **Type Variables:** Vehicle types such as mini-van, hatchback, coupe, etc., also have infinite VIF.
      - **Fuel Types:** All fuel type categories have infinite VIF.
      - **Transmission Types:** Transmission types have infinite VIF.

    - **Results:** are rather worse after dropping 'inf' multi-collinearity columns as determined by VIF.
        - Linear Regression: RMSE = 5927.4558, R2 = 0.6194
        - Ridge Regression: RMSE = 5927.4559, R2 = 0.6194
        - Lasso Regression: RMSE = 5927.4650, R2 = 0.6194
        - Elastic Net Regression: RMSE = 6233.9973, R2 = 0.5790

- **Cross Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning** was performed to evaluate the models. The performance remains unchanged as expected since Linear Regression does not have hyperparameters to tune. It serves as a baseline for comparison. Based on the post-tuning metrics, Linear Regression is the best performing model with the lowest RMSE and highest R2 score, making it the preferred choice for predicting used car prices in this context.
    - Linear Regression: Cross-validation RMSE = 5608.2921
    - Best Ridge: {'alpha': 100.0}, RMSE = 5620.4871
    - Best Lasso: {'alpha': 0.1}, RMSE = 5620.5940
    
    - Evaluate the best models on the test set

        - Ridge: RMSE = 5676.8223, R2 = 0.6509
        - Lasso: RMSE = 5676.3500, R2 = 0.6510
          
- **Best Model: Linear Regression with cross-validation**
    - Mean cross-validation score: 0.6627814416762869
    - Standard deviation of cross-validation score: 0.007372523909095059
